##Chosen game
I have chosen the BA game called *Time Flies* AKA *Clock'd* to design a controller for.

##Market research
Most common controllers these days have the same generic design, as they are made to be able to play with lots of different games. Furthermore lots of R&D has gone into designing the modern Xbox, Playstation and Wii controller designs, so that generic design style is evidently one of the most prefered and ergonomic designs for most games.

Example of a popular controller:

This controller design style would be appropriate for the game I have chosen, however I am going to try and come up with a controller that will hopefully be more suited for the game at hand.

Example of a popular controller designed for a specific game:

The Guitar Hero controller is a prime example of when a controller desinged for a specifc game can work very well.

##Initial Design proposal

I will attempt to create a multi-player controller where two people can use it a the same time. Similar to the wii nunchuk design, but with two sets of mini controllers.

First Quick concepts:

From these prototypes I prefer the number 4 design as it allows for two people to hold the controllers independently without the others hand movements affecting their controls.

My further design concepts:

This is the controller style I am looking to go for, where each player has one small controler with movement keys, puch and kick.
